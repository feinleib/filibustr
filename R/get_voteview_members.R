#' Get data on members of Congress from Voteview
#'
#' `get_voteview_members()` returns a tibble of data on members of Congress,
#' sourced from [Voteview](https://voteview.com/data). Members in the data include
#' Senators, Representatives, and Presidents. Each row is one member in one
#' Congress (i.e., each member is listed once for every two years in office).
#'
#' @param chamber Which chamber to get data for. Options are:
#'  * `"all"`, `"congress"`: Both House and Senate data (the default).
#'  * `"house"`, `"h"`, `"hr"`: House data only.
#'  * `"senate"`, `"s"`, `"sen"`: Senate data only.
#'  These options are case-insensitive. If you explicitly pass a different value,
#'  it will default to "all" with a warning.
#'
#' Note that presidents are included in all datasets. Therefore, reading *both* `"house"`
#' and `"senate"` data will duplicate data on the presidents. The recommended way to get
#' all data is to use the default argument, `"all"`.
#'
#' @param congress A whole number (to get data for a single Congress), or
#'  a numeric vector (to get data for a set of congresses).
#'  Optional; will retrieve data for all Congresses by default.
#'  If specified, Congress numbers cannot be greater than the [current_congress()]
#'  (i.e., you cannot try to get future data).
#'
#' @param local `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')` `r doc_arg_local("Voteview")`
#'
#' @param local_dir `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')` The directory containing
#'  the local file. Defaults to the working directory.
#'
#' @returns A [tibble()].
#'
#' The tibble includes data on the member's office, party, and ideology.
#' See [Voteview](https://voteview.com/data) for descriptions of specific columns.
