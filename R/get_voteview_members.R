#' Get data on members of Congress from Voteview
#'
#' `get_voteview_members()` returns a tibble of data on members of Congress,
#' sourced from [Voteview](https://voteview.com/data). Members in the data include
#' Senators, Representatives, and Presidents. Each row is one member in one
#' Congress (i.e., each member is listed once for every two years in office).
#'
#' @param chamber (Optional) Which chamber to get data for. Options are:
#'  * `"all"`, `"congress"`, `"hs"`: Both House and Senate data (the default).
#'  * `"house"`, `"h"`, `"hr"`: House data only.
#'  * `"senate"`, `"s"`, `"sen"`: Senate data only.
#'
#'  These options are case-insensitive. If you explicitly pass a different value,
#'  it will default to "all" with a warning.
#'
#'  Note that presidents are included in all datasets. Therefore, reading *both* `"house"`
#'  and `"senate"` data will duplicate data on the presidents. The recommended way to get
#'  all data is to use the default argument, `"all"`.
#'
#' @param congress (Optional) A whole number (to get data for a single Congress), or
#'  a numeric vector (to get data for a set of congresses).
#'
#'  If not provided, will retrieve data for all Congresses by default.
#'  If specified, Congress numbers cannot be greater than the [current_congress()]
#'  (i.e., you cannot try to get future data).
#'
#' @param local_path (Optional) A file path for reading from a local file. If no
#'  `local_path` is specified, will read data from the Voteview website.
#'
#' @returns A tibble.
#'
#' The tibble includes data on the member's office, party, and ideology.
#' See [Voteview](https://voteview.com/data) for descriptions of specific columns.
