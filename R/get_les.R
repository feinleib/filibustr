#' Get Legislative Effectiveness Scores data
#'
#' `get_les()` returns [Legislative Effectiveness Scores data](https://thelawmakers.org/data-download)
#' from the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
#'
#' @inheritParams get_voteview_members
#'
#' @param chamber Which chamber to get data for. Options are:
#'  * `"house"`, `"h"`, `"hr"`: House data only.
#'  * `"senate"`, `"s"`, `"sen"`: Senate data only.
#'
#'  These options are case-insensitive. Any other argument results in an error.
#'
#'  **Note:** Unlike the Voteview functions, there is no `"all"` option.
#'  You *must* specify either House or Senate data, since there is no
#'  "default" option.
#'
#'  There are non-trivial differences between the House and Senate datasets,
#'  so take care when joining House and Senate data.
#'  Important differences include:
#'
#'  * **Legislator names** are formatted differently. The Senate data has
#'    `first` and `last` name columns, while the House data has a single
#'    `thomas_name` column.
#'  * **The `year` column** refers to the first year of the Congress in the
#'    House data, but `year` refers to the preceding election year in the
#'    Senate data. Thus, the `year` for House members is one after that of
#'    senators in the same Congress.
#'
#' @param les_2 Whether to use LES 2.0 (instead of Classic Legislative
#'  Effectiveness Scores).  LES 2.0 credits lawmakers when language
#'  from their sponsored bills is included in other legislators' bills
#'  that become law. LES 2.0 is only available for the 117th Congress.
#'  Classic LES is available for the 93rd through 117th Congresses.
#'
#' @param local `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')` Whether to read the
#'  data from a local file, as opposed to the Center for Effective Lawmaking
#'  website. Default is `TRUE`. If the local file does not exist, will fall
#'  back to reading from online.
#'
#' @returns A [tibble()].
