\usage{
get_voteview_member_votes(chamber = "all", congress = NULL, local_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{chamber}{Which chamber to get data for. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"}, \code{"congress"}, \code{"hs"}: Both House and Senate data (the default).
\item \code{"house"}, \code{"h"}, \code{"hr"}: House data only.
\item \code{"senate"}, \code{"s"}, \code{"sen"}: Senate data only.
}

These options are case-insensitive. If you explicitly pass a different value,
it will default to "all" with a warning.}

\item{congress}{(Optional) A whole number (to get data for a single Congress), or
a numeric vector (to get data for a set of congresses).

If not provided, will retrieve data for all Congresses by default.
If specified, Congress numbers cannot be greater than the \code{\link[=current_congress]{current_congress()}}
(i.e., you cannot try to get future data).}

\item{local_path}{(Optional) A file path for reading from a local file. If no
\code{local_path} is specified, will read data from the Voteview website.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[=tibble]{tibble()}}.
}
\description{
\code{get_voteview_member_votes()} returns a tibble that lists how each member
of Congress voted in recorded (roll call) votes in the House and Senate.
Members are identified by their ICPSR ID number, which you can use to
join with additional member data from \code{\link[=get_voteview_members]{get_voteview_members()}}.
