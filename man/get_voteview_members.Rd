\title{Get data on members of Congress from Voteview}
\usage{
get_voteview_members(chamber = "all", congress = NULL, local_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{chamber}{(Optional) Which chamber to get data for. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"}, \code{"congress"}, \code{"hs"}: Both House and Senate data (the default).
\item \code{"house"}, \code{"h"}, \code{"hr"}: House data only.
\item \code{"senate"}, \code{"s"}, \code{"sen"}: Senate data only.
}

These options are case-insensitive. If you explicitly pass a different value,
it will default to "all" with a warning.

Note that presidents are included in all datasets. Therefore, reading \emph{both} \code{"house"}
and \code{"senate"} data will duplicate data on the presidents. The recommended way to get
all data is to use the default argument, \code{"all"}.}

\item{congress}{(Optional) A whole number (to get data for a single Congress), or
a numeric vector (to get data for a set of congresses).

If not provided, will retrieve data for all Congresses by default.
If specified, Congress numbers cannot be greater than the \code{\link[=current_congress]{current_congress()}}
(i.e., you cannot try to get future data).}

\item{local_path}{(Optional) A file path for reading from a local file. If no
\code{local_path} is specified, will read data from the Voteview website.}
}
\value{
A tibble.

The tibble includes data on the member's office, party, and ideology.
See \href{https://voteview.com/data}{Voteview} for descriptions of specific columns.
}
\description{
\code{get_voteview_members()} returns a tibble of data on members of Congress,
sourced from \href{https://voteview.com/data}{Voteview}. Members in the data include
Senators, Representatives, and Presidents. Each row is one member in one
Congress (i.e., each member is listed once for every two years in office).
