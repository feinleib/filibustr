# filibustr: Data Utilities for Congressional Research

Provides easy-to-understand and consistent interfaces for accessing data
on the U.S. Congress. The functions in 'filibustr' streamline the
process for importing data on Congress into R, removing the need to
download and work from CSV files and the like. Data sources include
'Voteview' (<https://voteview.com/>), the U.S. Senate website
(<https://www.senate.gov/>), and more.
